This project represents the culmination of my year, serving as a comprehensive test of our C# proficiency. It delves into the realm of bitmap file manipulation, a distinct Windows file format designed for images.

Embarking on this endeavor, I found myself tasked with building everything from scratch - from file reading to the creation of image classes and, most importantly, the development of functions that could manipulate images. This encompassed a wide range of tasks, including applying filters via convolution matrices, rotations, enlargements, generating Mandelbrot fractals, image encryption, and implementing symmetries.

The second part of this project revolved around the design and decoding of QR codes from given phrases. This required meticulous adherence to format specifications and consideration of constraints, such as the utilization of the Reed-Solomon algorithm for error correction.

Finally, an essential aspect of this project lay in its presentation. I opted to utilize Windows Forms, a format provided by Windows that simplifies the creation of applications. It offered a user-friendly interface for the effective visualization of our work.
